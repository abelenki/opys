I originally wrote this as a way to learn Google AppEngine.  
It turns out that my elderly mother, who is an unpublished writer with a sizable 
but mostly unpublished body of work, is amenable to publishing her work
online.  I therefore set up this project to publish her poems - I will 
scan and upload them as time permits to http://bea-sisk.appspot.com.

The project can be customized to suit other purposes.  The first few lines of
opys.py contain the following fields:

#CONFIG: Change this to suit yourself
ADMINISTRATOR = 'administrator'
SITE_TITLE = "A Child of Hard Times"
SITE_SUBTITLE = "Poems by Bea Sisk"
COPYRIGHT_NOTICE = "&copy;Bea Sisk 2012 - All rights reserved, no wrongs deserved."

Change the name of the administrator account to suit yourself.  Only administrators
have right to add, edit or delete any material on the site.

Feel free to use this code as you like.  If you find it useful, drop me a line.

NOTE - 12/9/2012: I am giving up on making the site generally configurable.  There 
is a fair amount of HTML on the index template index.html that is specific to my 
site.  If you want to use the code for your own purposes, you will have to rip it 
out or edit it to suit.  Feel free to do so.
